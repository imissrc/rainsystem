Code for Paper ["Memory Oriented Transfer Learning for Semi-Supervised Image Deraining"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Huang_Memory_Oriented_Transfer_Learning_for_Semi-Supervised_Image_Deraining_CVPR_2021_paper.html)

## Prerequisites
* Python 3
* PyTorch

## Models

We provide the model trained on DDN-SIRR dataset in the following links:

* [Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ob4ATRd5bKtGLEzPhL84saY3tUW33Lu4?usp=sharing) 
* [Jianguo Yun](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/Deq2B2gQiaCuBxjy9IUE)

## Run

	 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py --config_file='test.yaml'

Adjust the parameters in 'test.yaml' according to your own settings.
The training code will be released later.
